# Case Study for Target TTS Recruiting

## Tech Stack

In this section, 

1. React
    - Popular library for developing web application user interfaces
2. Material UI
    - Fantastic 
3. Jest
    - Great for testing Components and 
4. 

## Instructions
The following sections detail the instructions to build and run the project, as well as run any tests.
The main set of instructions, common to both are as follows:

### Build & Run the App
To build and run the app, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to `tgt-case-study/src/`
3. Type `npm run prod`


### Run Tests
Test-driven development (TDD) is a valuable approach when developing code. TDD help the developer consider the various scenarios and associated behavior that is expected of the component (or class, if we're speaking generally). Regardless, unit tests and integration tests are important because they can prove that the code works without needing a fully-functional and running application.

To actually run the tests in this project, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to `tgt-case-study/src/`
2. Type `npm run test` and press Enter
3. Test should run (and hopefully pass)
